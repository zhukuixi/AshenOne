#### VIPER: variability-preserving imputation for accurate gene expression recovery in single-cell RNA sequencing studies 

**[A tool for scRNAseq imputation based on regression]**

Since cell\_i,gene\_j's value is dropout. We do the regression on other genes of cell\_i, where the predictors are the gene values from other cells. The beta value is fixed which stands for the predictive a cell is for cell\_i.
