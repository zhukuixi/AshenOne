# Framing The Question
1.Frame question  
2.Classify question (what type of question is this and what is the best evidence to address that question?)

## Resources for How to Frame Your Question
1. <Finding what works in health care>
2. <Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions>

## Deciding the Type and Scope of Your Question

### Type
* Without knowing what type of question you are asking, you won't be able to find relevant research fitted for the meta-analsyis.

### Scope
* Trade off between the broadness of question and the number of studies available
* Narrow questions:  
	1. Fewer studies.  
	2. Can result in spurious or biased conclusions (like subgroup analysis)   
* Board questions:   
	1. May not be valid (apples and oranges)  
	2. More time-consuming when searching data
	3. Synthesis and interpretation difficult
	4. Difficult to maintain ( can split broad question into subparts)
* Ways similar studies may differ.

## Elements of the Question
1.Frame question    
2.Classify question (what type of question is this and what is the best evidence to address that question?)  
3.Well-formulated questions can help you determine the criteria for studies selection.

* Component of Well-Constructed and "Answerable" Clinical Questions  
**PICO**: **P**eople, **I**ntervention, **C**omparisons, **O**utcome

## Refining the Question (regarding PICO)
Each outcome has five elements :  
1. Domain (anxiety)  
2. Specific measurements (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale)  
3. Specific metrics (change from base line)  
4. Methods of aggregation (mean,median)  
5. Time points (3 months)
