# Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis

## Definition

### Background 
* Typical Clinical Questions:  
It is all about comparing the effect of two intervention methods.(Case v.s Control)

* Too much information floating in the air (So Many info are trash in trash out!) so we need to systematically handle these information and come to one conclusion

	Systematic Review:
	* Start from a specific question
	* Uses explicit,pre-planned scientific methods to 
	   1. Identify
	   2. Select
	   3. Appraise
	   4. Summarize 
	   similar but separate studies.

#
	Meta-analysis (is an optional componnet of a systematic review):
	* A statistical analysis which combines the results of several independent 
	  studies considered by the analyst to be "combinable".
	* Use Forest Plot for presentation.
	* General Framework for meta-analysis:
		1. What is the direction of effect?  (方向）
		2. What is the size of effect? （大小）
		3. Is the effect consistent across studies? （一致性）
		4. What cause different results among studies (investigate heterogenity)? （不一致性的原因）
		5. What is the strength of evidence of the effect?

* When not to meta-analysis
