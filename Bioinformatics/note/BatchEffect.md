### What is batch effect?
A large, complex, multi-faceted, multi-institutional project such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)  collects tumor samples in different institutions and at different times. **Because the samples are processed in batches rather than all at once, the data can be vulnerable to systematic noise such as batch effects** (unwanted variation between batches) and trend effects (unwanted variation over time), which can lead to misleading analysis results.
